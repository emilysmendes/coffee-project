# Coffee Project

Worked in collaboration with a partner to design and develop a web-based coffee website, with a primary focus on enhancing the user experience and interface. We utilized dynamic elements that were drawn from an object array to display coffee names and roast types and also implemented local storage functionality that enabled users to save and retrieve their search results. To further improve the user experience, we added the ability for users to create new coffee types and roasts and also incorporated filtering options by roast type through key entry or selection. 

Skills: Paired programming, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
